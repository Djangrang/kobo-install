The purpose of the script is to install `KoBoToolbox ` in minutes without messing with configuration files.  
It prompts the user to answer some questions to create configuration files automatically and to start docker containers based on [`kobo-docker`](https://github.com/kobotoolbox/kobo-docker "").

## Important notice when upgrading from [`2.019.52-final-shared-database`](https://github.com/kobotoolbox/kobo-install/releases/tag/2.019.52-final-shared-database) or earlier

Up to and including release `2.019.52-final-shared-database`, [KPI](https://github.com/kobotoolbox/kpi) and [KoBoCAT](https://github.com/kobotoolbox/kobocat) both shared a common Postgres database. They now each have their own. **If you are upgrading an existing single-database installation, you must follow [these instructions](https://community.kobotoolbox.org/t/upgrading-to-separate-databases-for-kpi-and-kobocat/7202)** to migrate the KPI tables to a new database and adjust your configuration appropriately.

## Warning for `kobo-docker` installations made prior to March 2019

If you have already installed `KoBoToolbox` with `kobo-docker` prior March 2019,
you **must** complete [a manual upgrade process](https://github.com/kobotoolbox/kobo-docker/#important-notice-when-upgrading-from-commit-5c2ef02-march-4-2019-or-earlier)
before using this repository. **If you do not, `kobo-install` will not be able to start.**

## Usage

`$kobo-install> python run.py`

First time the command is executed, setup will be launched.   
Subsequent executions will launch docker containers directly.

Rebuild configuration:  
`$kobo-install> python run.py --setup`

Get info:  
`$kobo-install> python run.py --info`

Get docker logs:  
`$kobo-install> python run.py --logs`

Update KoBoToolbox:  
`$kobo-install> python run.py --update`

Stop KoBoToolbox:  
`$kobo-install> python run.py --stop`

Get help:  
`$kobo-install> python run.py --help`

Get version:
`$kobo-install> python run.py --version`

Build kpi and kobocat (dev mode):  
`$kobo-install> python run.py --build`

Run docker commands on frontend containers:
`$kobo-install> python run.py --compose-frontend [docker-compose arguments]`

Run docker commands on backend containers:
`$kobo-install> python run.py --compose-backend [docker-compose arguments]`

Start maintenance mode:
`$kobo-install> python run.py --maintenance`

Stop maintenance mode:
`$kobo-install> python run.py --stop-maintenance`

## Build the configuration
User can choose between 2 types of installations:

- `Workstation`: KoBoToolbox doesn't need to be accessible from anywhere except the computer where it's installed. No DNS needed 
- `Server`: KoBoToolbox needs to be accessible from the local network or from the Internet. DNS are needed

<sup>1)</sup> _HTTPS certificates must be installed on a Reverse Proxy. 
`KoBoInstall` can install one and use `Let's Encrypt` to generate certificates thanks to [nginx-certbot project](https://github.com/wmnnd/nginx-certbot "")_

<sup>2)</sup> _Custom settings are provided by [PostgreSQL Configuration Tool API](https://github.com/sebastianwebber/pgconfig-api "")_

ℹ  Intercom App ID [must now](https://github.com/kobotoolbox/kpi/pull/2285) be configured through "Per user settings" in the Django admin interface of KPI.
